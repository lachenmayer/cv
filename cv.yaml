    Description: |
      Redux implemented with React setState().
      Built when I was building a super-quick React prototype, and didn't want to import Redux & deal with its boilerplate.
      Interestingly, this exact feature is now (as of September 2017) built in to ReasonReact, Facebook's official React bindings to its Reason OCaml dialect. https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/blog.html#reducers-are-here

  - Name: FilePigeon
    Start: March 2017

    Description: |
      Send files directly from your laptop to people nearby.
      You can drag files into the app, and FilePigeon will start a local HTTP server, and give you a link that you can share with friends on the same network.
      They will then be able to download the files directly from your computer, using your fast local connection.
